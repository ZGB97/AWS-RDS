<h1>Creating and Managing a MySQL Database Instance (Amazon RDS) </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I completed a lab focused on setting up and managing an Amazon RDS database instance. The tasks involved creating a security group, launching an RDS database instance, and connecting to the database using MySQL Workbench. Specifically, I created a security group with the necessary inbound rules, launched a MySQL RDS instance with specific configuration settings, and successfully connected to the database instance using MySQL Workbench to perform database operations.
